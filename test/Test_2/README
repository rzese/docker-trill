Test 2

This test considers the artificial KB shown in the following:

C_{1,1} \subseteq C_{1,2} \subseteq ...} \subseteq C_{1,x} \subseteq C_{x+1}
C_{1,1} \subseteq C_{2,2} \subseteq ...} \subseteq C_{2,x} \subseteq C_{x+1}
C_{1,1} \subseteq C_{3,2} \subseteq ...} \subseteq C_{3,x} \subseteq C_{x+1}
...
C_{1,1} \subseteq C_{y,2} \subseteq ...} \subseteq C_{y,x} \subseteq C_{x+1}
a : C_{1,1}

with m and n varying to increase the number of axioms.

This thes considers x and y taking values from 1 to 7, step 1 and from 10 to 100, step 10
for a total of 149 KBs, each one in its folder.

The query executed is:
a : C_{x+1}

Use runall.sh to run all the tests. Use run_1-7.sh to run test with x and y taking values only from 1 to 7,
or use run_10-100.sh for using KBs with x and y between 10 and 100.
Each test collects the average running time over 50 executions of the query for each KB. However, with
the script get_all_times.sh it is possible to collect all the results at the same moment.
