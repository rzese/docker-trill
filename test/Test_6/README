Test 6

This test considers versions of BRCA of increasing size generated following the method presented in [1].

There are KBs of increasing size created by starting from the original (probabilistic) TBox and added
a number of (probabilistic) sub-class axioms varying from 9 to 26. For each number, 100 different consistent
ontologies were created.

Two queries for each KB of each size are executed.

Use runall.sh to run all the tests. Otherwise, in the folder run_scripts you can run this test using
one particular reasoner. Each test collects the average running time. However, with the script
get_all_times.sh it is possible to collect all the results at the same moment.
