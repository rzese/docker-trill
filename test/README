This folder contains KBs and scripts to run the 5 tests presented in the paper
Zese R., and Cota G., Optimizing Tableau Reasoning: a Prolog-based Framework.

In each test folder there is a README with the description of the test and the instructions to run it.

The script SET_VERSION.sh is used to switch among the two versions considered in the paper.
It takes one argument telling which version to use.
To use the new version, run:
SET_VERSION.sh new
To use the old version, run:
SET_VERSION.sh old
