Test 1

This tests considers KBs, modeling real world domains.
Datasets:
- BioPAX level 3 (http://www.biopax.org/), which models metabolic pathways;
– BRCA (http://www2.cs.man.ac.uk/~klinovp/pronto/brc/cancer_cc.owl), which models the
  risk factors of breast cancer depending on many factors such as age and drugs taken;
– an extract of DBPedia ontology (http://dbpedia.org/), containing structured
  information of Wikipedia, usually those contained in the information box on
  the right-hand side of a page;
– Vicodi [1], which contains information on European history and models historical
  events and important personalities.


50 queries per KB per type of test.

Tests for:
- qo: queries with no justifications
- q1: queries with one or more justifications finding only 1 justification
- qa: queries with one or more justifications finding all the justifications
- qp: probabilistic queries

Use runall.sh to run all the tests. Otherwise, in the folder run_scripts you can run single tests.
Each test collects the average running time. However, with the script get_all_times.sh it is
possible to collect all the results at the same moment.
