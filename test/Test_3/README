Test 4

This test considers the artificial KB shown in the following:

B_{iâˆ’1} \sqsubseteq P_{i} \cup Q_{i}
P_{i} \sqsubseteq B_{i}
Q_{i} \sqsubseteq B_{i}

with i taking values from 1 to n. With positive n, the query B_{0} \sqsubseteq B_{n} has 2^n justifications.
This Kb is taken from Example 8 in [1].

In this test, i takes values 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

Use runall.sh to run all the tests and compute the average running time over 50 executions of the query
for each KB.
However, with the script get_all_times.sh it is possible to collect all the results at the same moment.
